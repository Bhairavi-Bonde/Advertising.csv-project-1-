# Overview
This project involves using linear regression to analyse advertising data provided in CSV format. The goal is to build a predictive model that can help predict the sales on different advertising platforms.

# What is linear regression?
Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

# Requirements
I’ve used the following software and libraries to run the project. 
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Scikit-learn
5. Matplotlib
6. Google Colab

# Data
The csv file has been downloaded from google. The file contains 4 columns, i.e TV, Radio, Newspaper and Sales.

# Preprocessing
1) Handling outliers and missing values
2) Assumption of Linearity
3) Data Normalisation
4) Checking of multicollinearity in data
